# cs325-GroupAssignment-3
## Goal
Design an algorithm to compute the first, second, and third minimum spanning trees. Prove that your algorithm is correct. (For full credit, the algorithm must run in O(V 2E log V ). However, obtaining an O(V E) time algorithm is not too hard.)
## Input/Output 
Your program reads from one text file, “input.txt”. The first line is one integer
1 ≤ n ≤ 30. The following n lines each is a row of the adjacency matrix of G, that is the ith number
of the jth row is the weight of the the (i, j) edge (You can assume that the graph is complete, and
all weights are non-negative integers). (There will be test cases with 100 vertices for extra credit.)
Your output must be written in “output.txt”. The output is composed of three numbers, each
written in a separate line: the weights of the first, second, and third minimum spanning trees in
order
